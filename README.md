# Finding-pi
Hi!
I am Anubhav Dash, this is one of the assignments given for beginners after learning Python Syntax. 
This Program basically asks you how many digits of Pi you want to see and then prints it.
Note:- Don't go too ballistic and type a huge number which your computer can't process otherwise the program will crash.
The Reason of uploading this is to get critics on how this can be improved so feel free to message me if you want to see some changes.
Thanks.
